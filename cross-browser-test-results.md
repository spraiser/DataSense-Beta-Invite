## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Chrome (Windows/Mac)
**Version Tested:** 120.x

#### file:// Protocol
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Mouse leave detection | ❌ | Security restrictions prevent mouseleave on file:// |
| Popup appearance | ✅ | Displays correctly when triggered |
| ROI calculator | ✅ | Functions properly |
| Session storage | ⚠️ | Works but may be cleared frequently |
| Fallback triggers | ✅ | All fallback triggers functional |
| Console logging | ✅ | All debug logs visible |

#### https:// Protocol
| Feature | Status | Notes |

## Console Output Analysis

### Expected Console Logs
```javascript
// Successful initialization
"Exit intent init: {overlay: true, closeBtn: true, ...}"
"Browser detected: Chrome, Protocol: file://"

// Mouse tracking (near edge)
"Mouse near top edge: clientY=3"
"Mouse near top edge: clientY=1"

// Successful trigger
"Mouse leave detected: {clientY: -1, ...}"
"Triggering exit popup on mouse leave - conditions met"
"Exit popup displayed - trigger: mouse_leave"
```

### Common Warning Messages
```javascript
// file:// protocol warnings (expected)
"SessionStorage not available: SecurityError"
"Could not save to sessionStorage: SecurityError"

// These are NORMAL for file:// testing
```

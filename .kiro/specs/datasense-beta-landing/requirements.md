# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a relatable, conversion-focused beta tester landing page for DataSense, designed specifically for small business owners who can't afford enterprise data infrastructure but desperately need quick insights to compete. The page must speak directly to business owners in their own voice, emphasizing collaboration and practical benefits rather than technical jargon. The goal is to attract small business leaders who recognize they're drowning in data but can't access the insights that could transform their business, and show them how DataSense levels the playing field.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a small business owner who knows my data holds answers but can't afford a data team, I want to immediately see how DataSense will help me make better decisions and grow my business, so that I can determine if this is the solution I've been looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user lands on the page THEN the system SHALL speak directly to small business owners with relatable language about turning data into competitive advantage
2. WHEN a user reads the opening section THEN the system SHALL present the core promise in business owner terms: "Get the insights big companies pay millions for, without the complexity or cost"
3. WHEN a user evaluates the value proposition THEN the system SHALL use customer voice and real scenarios rather than corporate speak
4. IF a user needs proof of impact THEN the system SHALL show practical examples: "Find out which customers are worth 23% more, or which marketing actually works - in 30 seconds, not 30 days"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a small business owner tired of waiting weeks for simple answers about my own business, I want to understand how DataSense will let me and my team get instant insights without needing technical expertise, so that we can all make smarter decisions together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user explores the benefits THEN the system SHALL explain in plain language how DataSense eliminates the "let me get back to you next week" problem
2. WHEN a user considers team impact THEN the system SHALL show how their sales person, marketing coordinator, and operations manager can all get their own answers instantly
3. WHEN a user evaluates the collaboration aspect THEN the system SHALL demonstrate how everyone on the team becomes empowered to discover insights, not just the "numbers person"
4. IF a user wants to understand the transformation THEN the system SHALL use relatable scenarios: "Instead of guessing which customers might churn, you'll know exactly who needs attention today"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a small business owner who's tired of complex software that takes forever to implement, I want a simple way to join the beta that shows DataSense understands my need for quick, practical solutions, so that I can start getting value immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user decides to join the beta THEN the system SHALL provide a straightforward signup form that feels approachable, not corporate
2. WHEN a user completes the signup form THEN the system SHALL ask practical questions about their business challenges in conversational language
3. WHEN a user submits their information THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation that reinforces the "working in hours, not months" promise
4. IF a user encounters form errors THEN the system SHALL display friendly, helpful messages that maintain the collaborative tone
5. WHEN a user successfully signs up THEN the system SHALL send a personal confirmation email that feels like it's from a real person who understands small business challenges

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user browsing on my phone or tablet, I want the beta landing page to work perfectly on my device, so that I can easily read content and sign up regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the page on mobile THEN the system SHALL display all content in a readable, properly formatted layout
2. WHEN a user interacts with forms on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly input fields and buttons
3. WHEN a user navigates on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain fast loading times and smooth scrolling
4. IF a user rotates their device THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a marketing team member tracking campaign performance, I want to measure the effectiveness of the beta landing page, so that I can optimize conversion rates and understand user behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the page THEN the system SHALL track key engagement metrics (time on page, scroll depth, form interactions)
2. WHEN users convert to beta signups THEN the system SHALL record conversion events for analysis
3. WHEN marketing campaigns drive traffic THEN the system SHALL support UTM parameter tracking for source attribution
4. IF A/B testing is needed THEN the system SHALL support variant testing capabilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DataSense team member managing the beta program, I want to receive and organize beta signup information efficiently, so that I can quickly follow up with qualified prospects and manage the beta cohort effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up for beta THEN the system SHALL store their information in an organized, accessible format
2. WHEN new signups occur THEN the system SHALL notify the team through email or integration with existing tools
3. WHEN reviewing signups THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and sorting capabilities for prospect management
4. IF integration is needed THEN the system SHALL support connection to CRM or email marketing platforms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a small business owner who's been burned by overpromising software before, I want to see that DataSense is built by people who understand my challenges and can deliver real results, so that I feel confident this beta is worth my time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user evaluates credibility THEN the system SHALL display authentic testimonials from other small business owners in relatable language
2. WHEN a user considers the discovery benefits THEN the system SHALL present specific, believable examples: "Discover that your Tuesday customers spend 23% more" or "Find out which of your deals will actually close"
3. WHEN a user assesses legitimacy THEN the system SHALL provide genuine company information that shows real people behind the product
4. IF a user needs social proof THEN the system SHALL include stories from beta testers who sound like peers, not corporate case studies
